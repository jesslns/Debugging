This repo contains information in utilising tools that can be helpful for debugging. I recorded methods that I have used and found helpful in my debugging process. As well as serving as a documentation of my personal learning, I hope it can be a useful resources to other new developers!

### The principles
```
1) Tighten the loop
2) Gain visibility
